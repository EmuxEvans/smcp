SMCP To-Do List
===============

In no particular order...

 * Observing support.
 * Lower stack usage.
    - For example, avoid passing the smcp instance as the
	  first argument on embedded platforms.
 * Clean up `smcpctl` source code. What a mess!
 * Add support for blocked transfers to the list method.
 * Lower code size footprint. Simplify. Refactor.
 * Reduce code size and complexity.

More to come.
